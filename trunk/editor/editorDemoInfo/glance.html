      Then and Now
   </div>
   <p style="padding: 3px;">
      Back in the early days of the web, applications that required user input had only
      a small set of input fields that were understandable by Web browsers.  These consisted
      of single-line text boxes, check boxes, and the multi-line text area.  This was fine
      when the majority of the users of the web was technical.   For example, they could
      still perform tasks such as editing of formatted documents by using plain text and
      a series of patterns of characters that indicated the structure of the document.
      The most common was then, and still is, HTML.
   </p>
   <p style="padding: 3px;">
      Fast forward a few years.  The web has gone main stream.   It is no longer the case
      that the majority of the users of the web are technical.  Today the web is visited
      by people of every imaginable skill, education level, and life experience.  Therefore,
      applications now need to provide interfaces that meet the needs of all those groups.
      Instead of editing raw text and markup, it is far more convenient for most users
      to work with &quot;Word Processor&quot; style document editing.   It is far simpler
      for, say, a grandmother to make some text bold by just selecting it and clicking
      on a &quot;bold&quot; button, than it is for her to know cryptic series of characters
      have to be put around text in order for it to be processed as bold.

      Simply put, if you want to expand the reach and usability of your applications that
      allow document-style input on the web, then you need a Rich Text Editor.  The Dojo
      Toolkit Rich Text Editor is designed to meet the requirements of many of these applications.
      It is a flexible, pluggable, editor that can expose as few, or as many, editing features
      as your application may require.  The following list provides a quick overview of
      the powerful capabilities of the Dojo Toolkit Rich Text Editor.

      Features
   </div>
   <ol>
      <li style="padding: 3px;">
         Provides Rich Text (word processor-like), editing of HTML documents.
      </li>
      <li style="padding: 3px;">
         Provides a large selection of built-in actions.  The default rich text editor of
         the dojo toolkit provides built-in commands for nearly all the common word processor
         type actions, such as bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript,
         indent, delete, insert, and so on.
      </li>
      <li style="padding: 3px;">
         Provides cross-browser support. The RTE capabilities of browsers vary in what they
         provide and how they are set up. The dijitEditor abstracts this away and provides
         a single way to create a rich-text editing field in your pages.
      </li>
      <li style="padding: 3px;">
         Provides built-in filtering support. The editor provides hooks to register HTML and
         DOM filters with the editor, to pre and post process data going in, or coming out
         of, the document being edited.
      </li>
      <li style="padding: 3px;">
         Provides a pluggable architecture. The editor's functionality is not limited to the
         set provided by the Dojo toolkit.  It can be extended by implementing plugins, following
         the &quot;dijit._editor.Plugin&quot; interface.  In fact, all the base commands of
         editor are implemented as instances of that plugin interface. The plugin architecture
         makes it relatively easy to add new buttons and actions to the toolbar as well as
         'headless plugins', which simply register filters or augments existing actions.
